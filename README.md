# PrintrbotSME3DV6_wHtdBed
Repo for my Printrbot Simple Metal that's heavily modded.

The Printrbot Simple Metal is a great printer, there are just a few things to bring it current. Some of my mods to do just that:
- [E3D V6 hot end](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/v6-hotend-full-kit-1.75mm-universal/sk/M4UK0AVU). See my [blog](https://designbuildfix.blogspot.com/2019/05/printrbot-simple-metal-e3d-upgrade.html) regarding installation and notes.
- Octoprint server running on a Pi Zero. [Blog post](https://designbuildfix.blogspot.com/2019/11/pi-zero-w-octopi-printrbot-simple-metal.html)
- ATX PSU with remote on/off through OctoPrint. [Blog post](https://designbuildfix.blogspot.com/2020/06/atx-psu-for-3d-printer.html)
- Heated bed with boro glass+PEI surface. Blog post in the works!
- [Capacitive proximity switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Z8MM94/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=fintechcomm0f-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078Z8MM94&linkId=a193f07c2e3e735c67a93bb231643d63) to detect the new surface that an inductive sensor wouldn't find. Blog post in the works!
- [Bed FET](https://digital-sqrt.com/product/little-driver-1-9b-900watt-heated-bed-hot-end-power-mosfet-expansion-module/). This takes the load off of the Printrboard. JST pins are not meant to handle that kind of current. Don't buy the bottom of the barrel FETs off of Alibaba or Amazon. They're large, low quality, and less efficient.
